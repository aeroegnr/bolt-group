# This is a python program that takes user input of forces, moments, and 
# bolt position, and generates bolt loads on a bolt group


# In the current version it assumes all bolt have the same stiffness and diameter
# and has not been thoroughly validated.  It assumes all input is valid,
# except that it does check to ensure that the length of the two input arrays
# are equal
